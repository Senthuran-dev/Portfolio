# Personal Portfolio - Murugeshkumar Senthuran

This portfolio project was built as part of a Tailwind CSS bootcamp challenge. I developed it using only HTML and Tailwind CSS, focusing on responsive design, clean UI, and usability. 
Throughout the project, I explored Tailwindâ€™s utility-first classes to style various sections like Home, About, Projects, and Contact. I also implemented smooth scrolling, hover effects, 
a dynamic typing animation using Typed.js, and made the layout mobile-friendly. This experience helped me strengthen my frontend skills and taught me how to create scalable, maintainable UI 
components without writing custom CSS. It was a rewarding hands-on project that reflects my passion for clean and modern web development.
